Once upon a time, in a forest far away, a beautiful Cassava village lived in peace with several little animal friends.
One day, the Rains started to bring strange water, and the friends never appeared again.
This water was weakening the Sacred Cassava that the village hailed.
Nobody knew why the Rain had changed and affected the village.
Until one day... Plim... Yuca was the name, a young Cassava appeared.
As if had been born with a purpose given by the Sacred Cassava.
Yuca decided to go on a journey to the sky to find out what was wrong.
